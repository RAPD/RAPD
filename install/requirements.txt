Linux modules that need to be installed before installing RAPD2:
yum install epel-release
yum install blas-devel lapack-devel atlas-sse3-devel atlas-devel openblas-devel libffi-devel ImageMagick-devel

Required software that should be installed prior to RAPD2 install:
BEST (http://www.embl-hamburg.de/BEST/)
RADDOSE (included?)
MOSFLM (http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/harry/mosflm/)
XOalign.py (xdsme, https://code.google.com/p/xdsme/)

After installing BEST, you will have to go into the installation directory and inspect
'detector-inf.dat' to see if parameters for your detector are present. If not, you will 
have to input the parameters for your detector and give it a unique name. Then use the 
first column ('Name') and edit rapd_agent_strategy.py 'processBest' for the first line 
in command to specify the name of the detector (ie. 'best -f pilatus6m').If this is not
correct, your strategies will not be very accurate.

#For VIPS which is not required. Generates multi-layered tiffs of images for GUI.
yum install libtiff-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel
