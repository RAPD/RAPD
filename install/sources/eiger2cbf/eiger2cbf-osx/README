                         EIGER2CBF

This is an utility to extract individual images out of an HDF5
container as used by Dectris Eiger detectors. The images are written
to individual mini-CBF files which are similar to those written by
Dectris Pilatus. 
Program written by Takanori Nakane

The build on both Mac OSX and Linux requires a recent version of
CBFlib (at least 0.9.5) to have been built; source can be obtained from 

	http://www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/CBF/

The build also requires gcc to be installed (clang will work on a Mac,
and the Intel compilers also work, but both of these complain while
building. As with most complaints, they can be safely ignored).

The Makefile in this directory is for Linux; it references files in my
workspace. A second file, Makefile.osx is provided for use on Macs and
differs only in the locations of the C compiler and CBFlib files.

On Linux:

	make clean
	make

produces a statically linked executable called "eiger2cbf"

On OSX:

	make clean
	make -f Makefile.osx

produces a statically linked executable called "eiger2cbf"

Running eiger2cbf
=================
You shouldn't need more documentation than you get from running the
program (but a complete example is also below) e.g. - 

> ./eiger2cbf
EIGER HDF5 to CBF converter (version 160415)
 Written by Takanori Nakane

Usage:
  ./eiger2cbf filename.h5           -- get number of frames
  ./eiger2cbf filename.h5 N out.cbf -- write N-th frame to out.cbf
  ./eiger2cbf filename.h5 N         -- write N-th frame to STDOUT
  ./eiger2cbf filename.h5 N:M   out -- write N to M-th frames to outNNNNNN.cbf
  N is 1-indexed. The file should be "master" h5.


Example:
========
A data collection produces the following list of hdf5 files:

thaumatin17_2_1_data_000001.h5
thaumatin17_2_1_data_000001.h5
thaumatin17_2_1_data_000001.h5
thaumatin17_2_1_data_000001.h5
thaumatin17_2_1_data_000001.h5
thaumatin17_2_1_master.h5

Running eiger2cbf on the master file will give the number of images (500):

500
========================== End of listing =================================

Then run again specifying the images (all in this case) to be
extracted.  The metadata will be listed and then every cbf file
produced. 
The cbf filenames will be thaumatin_000001.cbf, thaumatin_000002.cbf etc
