### Getting Involved
It's not always clear in projects what needs to be done, or what the maintainers are willing to let new contributors (i.e. outsiders) do. The RAPD project is designed as a framework for building plugins, so there are many ways to contribute built into the design of the project.

Ways to help:
* Report a bug
* Make a feature request
* Test with a new version of dependent software and make a pull request
* Fix a bug and make a pull request
* Write a wrapper for a detector
* Write a plugin
* Write some documentation
